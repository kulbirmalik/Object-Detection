# Object-Detection
The project is used to detect various objects by using two algorithms used for object detection which are YOLO and RCNN. A basic comparison is made between the full procedure of how both the alogirthms detect the objects.

# Description Of The Project
The project consists of two files which have there code written in python as yolo.py and rcnn.py. By running both the files we can detect how the algorithms work. We have various images for yolo and rcnn in the respective folders . There are also sample videos present for both where the result obtained get stored in the form of a image and video respectively.

# System Requirments
1.Visual Studio Code<br/>
2.Python 3
3.Various python libraries are required
